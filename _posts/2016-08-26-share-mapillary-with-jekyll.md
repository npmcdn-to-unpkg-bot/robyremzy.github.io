Capturing the world around us involves a lot of fun and an adventure worth sharing. Maybe you want to explain how you captured, or just share a street-level experience. Learn here how to include navigable Mapillary sequences into a static web blog with Jekyll.

![Jekyllary]({{ "images/tmp/jekyllary.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
Include a Mapillary sequence into your Jekyll post with MapillaryJS
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Static web sites like Jekyll are often used to quickly support and share our posts, like on GitHub or on your own server with basically zero knowledge in web coding. Jekyll's contributors have already made some templates, occasionally with a Google map ready to use. Of course we can customize that with Leaflet or Mapbox, too, if we wish, but here we will focus on the Mapillary part. The rest of the blog framework should keep the same approach with some adjustments - Jekyll is famous for its easy [liquid templating](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and YAML data [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

### First things to setup
To use the Mapillary API you need to [register an application](https://www.mapillary.com/app/settings/developers) on your Mapillary account. We will use the **Client ID** later.

![appmapillary]({{ "images/tmp/regappmapi.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
Every field is required and the domain has to be correct
{: style="text-align: center;"}

Now, to embed street level imagery we will use [MapillaryJS](https://github.com/mapillary/mapillary-js). The whole MapillaryJS is available via CDN here, hosted on "unpkg". To keep it simple, we will use that solution, but it's possible to use it with "NPM" as well. We may from time to time check back on the version number and update the CDN.

It will also be a good idea to load MapillaryJS only when our post or article needs it. To do that we have to edit our `post.html` inside the `_layouts` directory. Edit like the example below, just after the layout front matter. We have to basically copy the CDN script and add an `if` tag condition relative to the **key: value** of `mapillary: ok` inside the post/page front matter.

{% raw %}
```html
---
layout: default
---
{% if page.mapillary %}
<!-- Loading Mapillary -->
<script src='https://unpkg.com/mapillary-js@1.6.0/dist/mapillary-js.min.js'></script>
<link href='https://unpkg.com/mapillary-js@1.6.0/dist/mapillary-js.min.css' rel='stylesheet' />
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

Now MapillaryJS will be loaded every time we add `mapillary: ok` to the post front matter. We can just paste some html inside our post content to render Mapillary.

{% raw %}
```html

A Mapillary blog post...

<div id='mly' style='width: 640px; height: 480px;'></div>

<script>
  var mly = new Mapillary.Viewer(
    'mly',
    '<your client id>',
    '<your photo id for initializing the viewer>',
  );
</script>

some other stuff going on here!

```
{% endraw %}

### Post enhancement
With many sequences to embed, things could get a little tiresome after a while. To maintain readability, our code should blend in as much as possible inside the post. We can drop the client ID straight into the the code, but since this value will not change so often, then why not paste it inside the `_config.yml` file? With Jekyll we can also use the liquid object **\{** **\{** **include** **\}** **\}** to call a file from the `_includes` directory.

Create a new file named `jk_mapillary.html` in the `_includes` folder and copy/paste the content below (feel free to customize).

{% raw %}
```html
{% if page.mapillary %}
<div id="mly" style='width: 640px; height: 480px;'></div>
{% endif %}>

{% if page.mapillary %}
<script>
var mly = new Mapillary.Viewer(
  'mly',
  '{{ site.mapillary_id }}',
  '{{ include.mly_pkey }}',
  {
    // see options: http://mapillary.github.io/mapillary-js/interfaces/ivieweroptions.html
    "cover": true,
    "renderMode": Mapillary.RenderMode.Fill,
    "basePanoramaSize": Mapillary.ImageSize.Size2048,
    "baseImageSize": Mapillary.ImageSize.Size320,
    "maxImageSize": Mapillary.ImageSize.Size2048,
  }
);
</script>
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

Few notes here:

- **\{** **\{** **page.mapillary** **\}** **\}** will check the key value of `mapillary` inside our blog post/page front matter.
- **\{** **\{** **site.mapillary_id** **\}** **\}** will check the key value of `mapillary_id` inside `_config.yml`.
- **\{** **\{** **include.mly_pkey** **\}** **\}** is special, it's an option of a liquid include object, here our *Photo Key* aka **mly_pkey** this time as a needed option when including the Mapillary tag into our post.

We need to include our Client ID inside `_config.yml`. Replace the `mapillary_id:` value with your new app **Client ID**.

```yml
mapillary_id: 4m4p1ll4ry1Dk3y42
```

Don't forget to include `mapillary: ok` (or any other value you want) into your post/page front matter.

We can find the photo key of our choice on the Mapillary map.

![photokey]({{ "images/tmp/photo_key.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
Here is where you find the photo key
{: style="text-align: center;"}

And now we have to drop our Mapillary liquid tag inside our post content with the photo key option where it should be rendered inside our post.

{% raw %}
```js

### Final render
These last days I was <s>capturing</s> mapillaring on foot with my phone - a castle in France called [Le Ch√¢teau de Vincennes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Vincennes). In fact when people saw me with my phone like this, they actually guessed I was capturing stuff but not photo mapping!

{% include jk_mapillary.html mly_pkey='jwT0dFh8hN5PpGakkiWfmg' %}
See more street level captures [nearby on Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat={{ page.mlat }}&lng={{ page.mlng }}&z=15)
{: style="text-align: center;"}
