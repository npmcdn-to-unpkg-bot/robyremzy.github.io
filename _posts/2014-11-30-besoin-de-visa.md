I've got many airports adventures to share but most of them are border line, no joke.
But to give you some pictures, Vietnam are likely to put you in custody in a 4 stars hotel while you are waiting for your visa to be done, and USA are more likely to put you in a TV show at mid way from "JAIL" to "Orange is the new black" while you are not waiting for your visa but waiting for your next flight on your way back without being deported and enjoy your day without your shoes and your cell phone.

To secure yourself from funny situations with some funny people you better check this website first, and if you need a VISA or a waiver application be sure to do it directly with the official authorities (most of the time cheaper, and done in the right way). Be sure to read carefully all the conditions of your VISA or waiver app, most definitely if you stay very close to 90 days or if you have to come back many times per year. You want to be safe form funny people if you don't respect some aspects of your emigration situation. Just check it twice with the emigration website of the country you want to visit.

While i'm thinking about traveling... long time ago (befor the apocalypse) you were able to smoke at +13,500 feet (everything higher must have pressurized cabins to keep the pilots and passengers safe and comfortable. The pressure and oxygen levels inside the cabin are set to correspond with those experienced at up to 7,000 feet, cargo or commercial flight are usually assigns a cruising altitude of up to 39,000 feet), or you were able to bring your 1.5L bottle of Mountain Dew (stuffed or not) and sleep well after that, well maybe not because at that time computer assistance during the flight was not so sharp, so it was sometime a bit funky depends on the skill of the pilot (stuffed or not) as well as the landing. Nowaday we barely feel something during the flight or the landing.

**How do i get my bag come out first?**<br>
Show up mostly late, but not at the last second, your bag will be stacked on top of the cart. Its probably 70-80% effective. Just don't be so late that yours is one of the last bags loaded.<br>
Baggage handler do two pickups, one to get the majority of the bags 1H before departure (D-60), one to get any missed 30min before departure (D-30).

One time, on a domestic flight i was very late but just in time to be loaded (~20 passengers). In a hurry the cute stewardess guide me inside the plane.<br>
Be myself, stand-up in front of two raw of impatient people in the air plain, staring at me or busy on their iStuff<br>
one guy: Ah finaly!... and then the unexpected: everybody applaused!...<br>
I did blush! and say something that i don't remember, odds 50%stupide or funny.<br>
<br>
*I did learn from MythBuster that a commercial flight is fully loaded of their passengers in less than 15min.*  

    
You are ready to back pack and fasten your seatbelt now.
