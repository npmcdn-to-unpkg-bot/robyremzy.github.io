###I've got many airports adventures to share ###
but most of them are border line, no joke.
But to give you some pictures, Vietnam are likely to put you in custody in a 4 stars hotel while you are waiting for your visa to be done, and USA are more likely to put you in a TV show at mid way from "JAIL" to "Orange is the new black" while you are not waiting for your visa but waiting for your next flight on your way back without being deported and enjoy your day without your shoes and your cell phone.  
To secure yourself from funny situations with some funny people you better check this website first, and if you need a VISA or a waiver application be sure to do it directly with the official authorities (most of the time cheaper, and with less odds of going south). Be sure to read carefully all the conditions of your VISA or waiver app, most definitely if you stay very close to 90 days or if you have to come back many times per year. You want to be safe form funny people if you don't respect some aspects of your emigration situation. Just check it twice with the emigration website of the country you want to visit.

###While i'm thinking about traveling...###
long time ago (befor the apocalypse) you were able to smoke at +13,500 feet (everything higher must have pressurized cabins to keep the pilots and passengers safe and comfortable. The pressure and oxygen levels inside the cabin are set to correspond with those experienced at up to 7,000 feet, cargo or commercial flight are usually assigns a cruising altitude of up to 39,000 feet), or you were able to bring your 1.5L bottle of Mountain Dew (stuffed or not) and sleep well after that, well maybe not because at that time computer assistance during the flight was not so sharp, so it was sometime a bit funky depends on the skill of the pilot (stuffed or not) as well as the landing. Nowaday we barely feel something during the flight or the landing.

###If you are a hardcore backpacker you want to know that###
**How do i get my bag come out first?**  
Show up mostly late, but not at the last second, your bag will be stacked on top of the cart. Its probably 70-80% effective. Just don't be so late that yours is one of the last bags loaded.  
Baggage handler do two pickups, one to get the majority of the bags 1H before departure (D-60), one to get any missed 30min before departure (D-30).

**How to find out if your flight has In-Seat power outlets?**  
It's always a very good idea to book your seat just after your flight purchase and [seatguru.com](http://www.seatguru.com) can help you to know what you can expect from that very seat. Usually In-seat power outlets are the same as a car power adapter. you can scroll seatguru by airline company [Here](http://www.seatguru.com/browseairlines/browseairlines.php) and check for your aircraft (carefull between domestic and international).  
**what if i took a windows seat?**  
If you took a windows seat great! But what kind of view you want to enjoy during your flight, the iceberg the lands the sea or avoid the shiny sunshine? check this at [planefinder.net](http://planefinder.net/). (we are able to enjoy for free this kind of map, because aircraft [transponder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_%28aeronautics%29) VHF,VFR are encryption free, if it was, it will be a technical challenge to decrypt all communications in time to set all the landings needed). You may need this cool web site to spot the sun [suncalc.net](http://suncalc.net), for a full view of the daylight just go [here](http://www.die.net/earth/). Want more? you need to check the awesome wind map at differences altitude, to check potential turbulences? [Here the mighty windyty.com](http://www.windyty.com/) my friend.  
**If things go sideways?**  
Well 3 things can happened
+ You get trash by liquid or food
+ You get check by some kind of gentlemen
+ Your luggage are not on the same flight as you were
Man be ready first think how to dress-up and it's always a good idea to bring with you an extra outfit.  
At the airport security and TSA mean you want to get out there asap, so no belt, no fancy shoes who can have some kind of metal, it's all about com-fit sneakers here and avoid very thin socks you want some mattress socks, nothing in your pocket but wear a jacket with useful pockets who let you have everything inside. You also want to drop your wallet from all business card or everything you don't actually really need, because if you'll get check, some gentlemen will scan or print all what they find as credit card, keys, licenses ect... strip your wallet, think about your phone too but that more complicate here.  
I know flight are cheaper with connection but avoid the just 1H connection, there is a better odds of a missing baggages here, specially in London. think about the weather also, rain and heavy fog can delay you landing so as your connection and luggages get lost easy right there. suite case are less check than backpack, and you should label yours and make sure that it will not do silly things, put it in a safe place with not too many range of motion. Don't be fool if someone want to open your bag he will whatever your locker, make it simple but not too much. if you care about rain or heavy dust there you go, use the plastic wrapping at the airport. Take a photo of your baggages when you are at the airport, that way when you will tell to the agent that your precious is missing show him the picture, he will write down everything he need about the shape size color of your missing one and ask him the phone number to call to get some news about them but don't hesitate to say that also to the people at the lobby of your hotel, they may used to do that and have their fast lane to make you happy.

###One time, on a domestic flight###
I was very late but just in time to be loaded (~20 passengers). In a hurry the cute stewardess guide me inside the plane.<br>
Be myself, stand-up in front of two raw of impatient people in the air plain, staring at me or busy on their iStuff  
one guy: Ah finaly!... and then the unexpected: everybody applaused!...<br>
I did blush! and say something that i don't remember, odds 50%stupide or funny.<br>
<br>
*I did learn from MythBuster that a commercial flight is fully loaded of their passengers in less than 15min.*  <br>

You are ready to back pack and fasten your seatbelt now.
