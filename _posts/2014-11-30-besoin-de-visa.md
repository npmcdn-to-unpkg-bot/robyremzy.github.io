I've got many airports adventures to share but most of them are border line, no joke.
But to give you some pictures, Vietnam are likely to put you in custody in a 4 stars hotel while you are waiting for your visa to be done, and USA are more likely to put you in a TV show at mid way from "JAIL" to "Orange is the new black" while you are not waiting for your visa but waiting for your next flight on your way back without being deported and enjoy your day without your shoes and your cell phone.

To secure yourself from funny situations with some funny people you better check this website first, and if you need a VISA or a waiver application be sure to do it directly with the official authorities (most of the time cheaper, and done in the right way). Be sure to read carefully all the conditions of your VISA or waiver app, most definitely if you stay very close to 90 days or if you have to come back many time per year. You want to be safe form funny people if you don't respect some aspect of your situation. Just check it twice with the emigration website of the country you want to travel.

While i'm thinking about traveling... long time ago (befor the apocalypse) you were able to smoke at 10,000 feets, or you were able to bring your 1.5L bottle of Mountain Dew (stuffed or not) and sleep well after that, well maybe not because at that time computer assistance during the flight was not so sharp, so it was sometime a bit funky depends on the skill of the pilot (stuffed or not) as well as the landing. Nowaday we barely feel something during the flight or the landing.
